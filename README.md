In the internship folder you can find folders named as `level1`, `level2` and `level3`. In each folder I tried to accomplish the task outlined [here](https://github.com/provectus/internship/tree/main/dataeng). Task description, solution and faced problems are provided in each folder by README file.

Here I would like to show my solution of __Coding Tasks for Data Engineers__.
